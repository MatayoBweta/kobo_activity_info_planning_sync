# Kobo Activity Info Planning Sync

This application is designed to process data obtained through Kobo forms from our partners and create a comprehensive Monitoring Plan. This plan will be subsequently uploaded into Activity Info for further monthly data collection and utilization.

Due to limitations in Activity Info that prevent the selection of multiple options and the execution of scripts using entered data, we have implemented the use of Kobo as an intermediary platform. Kobo enables us to effectively identify key information for monitoring and seamlessly transfer the data into Activity Info for more efficient management.
